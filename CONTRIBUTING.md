# Contributing Notes

## So you found something that you want changed?

### Fork this Repository

Press the fork button and create the repo inside your own folder

### Go to your forked repo and clone it

Next go to your cloned repository and clone it

For example:

```bash
# The below command will clone a fork of the repo (replace 'nolim1t'
# with your username) to a folder called 'lnd-unlock'
git clone git@github.com:nolim1t/docker-lnd-unlock.git lnd-unlock

```

### Create a branch

```bash
# this creates a branch called 'bugfix-branchname'
git checkout -b bugfix-branchname
```

The above command will checkout a new branch with the branchname you have specified.

### Do your changes

Do your changes as prescribed.

### When you are finished

Commit it as you have probably already done, then push the branch to your fork.

```bash
git push origin bugfix-branchname
```

It should now prompt you to open a pull request. Please put a meaningful description in the pull request.

## So you found something but don't want to change it?
